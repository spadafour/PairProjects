# Command Line Exercises



## Make Change

Write a command line program which prompts the user for the total bill, and the amount tendered. It should then display the change required.

```    
Please enter the amount of the bill: 23.65 <br/>
Please enter the amount tendered: 100.00 <br/>
The change required is 76.35
```

## Martian Weight

In case you've ever pondered how much you weigh on Mars, here's the calculation:

    Wm = We* 0.378

where 'Wm' is the weight on Mars, and 'We' is the weight on Earth

Write a command line program which accepts a series of Earth weights from the user  
and displays each Earth weight as itself, and its Martian equivalent.

``` 
Enter a series of Earth weights (space-separated): 98 235 185

98 lbs.on Earth, is 37 lbs.on Mars. 
235 lbs.on Earth, is 88 lbs.on Mars.
185 lbs.on Earth, is 69 lbs.on Mars. 
```     

### Decimal to Binary

Write a command line program which prompts the user for a series of decimal integer values separated by spaces. Each decimal integer is displayed along with its equivalent binary value.

```
Please enter in a series of decimal values (separated by spaces): 460 8218 1 31313 987654321

460 in binary is 111001100
8218 in binary is 10000000011010
1 in binary is 1
31313 in binary is 111101001010001
987654321 in binary is 111010110111100110100010110001
